## The big idea 
Through my term project I plan on creating a hangman game. For this game, I will be creating a list of movies and using loops and conditional statements to create the game so that the player keeps guessing the letters until he/ she gets its right or is out of turns. 

## Learning goals 
Through this project, not only do I want to strengthen my python skills, but also want to learn a new skill. I would like to learn and use Django to create my hangman illustration for my game. 

## Implementation plan 
I will be using LinkedIn Learning as well as YouTube tutorials to learn Django. Apart from this, I will also be seeking help from chat GPT if I were to get stuck, however, I hope to use this as my last resort. For any doubts that I may have while writing code, I will be refering to one of the resources listed above or using the code discussed in class. 

## Project Schedule 
I will spend the first week writing the basic code for the word guessing game. Then I will spend about a week learning Django and the next week coding the cartoons in the game. 

## Collaboration Plan 
I am doing this project alone. 

## Risks and Limitations 
I believe one of the biggest risks for this project is that I am not great at coding and learning Django will not be easy for me. Given this, I am concerned about the quality of the game and also about whether or not I will be able to complete this project on time with the time frame and complexities. 

## Course Content 
For this project, I believe iterations and conditional statements will be used alongside string manipulation.
